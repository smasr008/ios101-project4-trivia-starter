## Notes

I was very confused with this project. I seeked outside sources to learn more about Vstacks and Hstacks to impleent those as well as formatiing of the words and buttons to make them more visually appealing. I spent too much time trying to figure some things out that I didnt have enough time to explore the API request and finish this project full heartedly.
